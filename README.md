This code groups all link records into geographic clusters based on their midpoint locations, ensuring every link is assigned to one cluster and selecting cluster centers that sit near the geographic center of their members.

It then exports the full dataset into an Excel file with one tab per cluster (including headers), plus summary and unmatched tabs for reporting.
